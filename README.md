## modular Compute Shader based Particle System 

After understanding deferred lightning and unity's render pipeline with its command buffers, I wanted to find a clean way to create modular particle system. 

Basically, there are different compute shaders which all render to the same buffers.
Each Compute Shader is controlled by a script whereas its base is inherited from a ParticleBase class which again are managed by one ParticleCSManager.

feel free to use this code as you wish, any contributions and pull requests are welcome.
Tested on Win10 with 2019.1.10f1.

## thanks
Obviously I learned a lot creating [this](https://github.com/aivenhoe/simple-deferred-gpu-cubes "this") little project, so kudos again to the people mentioned here.
The modularized system and even some bits of code is heavily inspired by a workshop held by [milo](https://vvvv.org/users/milo "milo") and [raul](https://vvvv.org/users/Raul "raul"), back in 2015 at the [node15](https://nodeforum.org/activities/festival/node15/ "node15") festival.

here is a gif of a quick modification of the system with Ethan and his super jumping powers.
